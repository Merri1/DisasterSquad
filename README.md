# Disaster Squad 
Disaster Squad is a top-down real-time strategy game designed for players aged 12+.\
Our theme for this project was the United Nations Sustainable Development goal #13:
> **"Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"**

## 
This game was developed by [Conor](https://github.com/Crexenic), [Dominik](https://github.com/DominikGodlewski) and [Merri](https://github.com/merri1) as part of our third year Project\
and Group Dynamics module at Limerick Institute of Technology. We were tasked with\
creating a game from scratch using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library - [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/).
